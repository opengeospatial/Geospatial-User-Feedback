identifier:: /req/json/fb-item-content
part:: Every 200-response with the media type `application/geo+json` SHALL be
+
* a link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3[GeoJSON FeatureCollection Object] for feedback items, and
* a link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON Feature Object] for a single feedback record.

part:: The schema of all responses with the media type `application/geo+json` SHALL validate against the OpenAPI 3.0 schema document `ogcapi_feedback-item.yaml`.
====

NOTE: It should be noted that the `ogcapi_feedback-item.yaml` schema makes the `geometry` member mandatory because the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON RFC] requires that the `geometry` member be present.  A feedback item does not have any spatial characteristic so, as per the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946[GeoJSON RFC] the values of the `geometry` member SHALL be `null`.
