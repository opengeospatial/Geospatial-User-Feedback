== Requirements Class "Feedback Collection" (Component)

=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_user_feedback_collection.adoc[]

The Feedback Collection requirements class defines the requirements for a _feedback collection_.

A _feedback collection_ is an object that provides information about and access to a set of related <<feedback_item, feedbacks>>.Such a collection of feedbacks is also referred to as a catalog.

The schema for the feedback catalog is a specific implementation of the record collection defined in https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html#\_clause-core-record\_[OGC API - Records Standard].

While https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-004.html#\_clause-core-record\_[OGC API - Records Standard] defines the property conformsTo as optional, OGC API - Feedback
considers it as required and its value is fixed as "http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-feedback-2/2.0/conf/feedback" to indicate that all elements in the catalog follows the <<feedback_item, feedback item>> requirements.

Although this Standard does not mandate any particular encoding for a catalog, a JSON encoding is defined.

Other encodings are allowed but are not described in this Standard.
