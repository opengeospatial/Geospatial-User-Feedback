== *Geospatial User Feedback XML encoding*

The encoding rules for creating a XML encoding from a UML model documented in ISO 19139 [4] were used to elaborate the XML schemas described here. These encoding rules are coded in the ShapeChange [6] application. ShapeChange was used to automatically transform the UML model coming from the OGC 15-097 Geospatial User Feedback Conceptual Model [8] into the XML schemas that are complementing this standard. Since the conversion is automatic, this document will not provide tables describing the semantics of each element and the reader should refer to the conceptual model for details.

This encoding is intended for applications where the use of producerâ€™s metadata encoded in ISO 19115-1:2014 [3] is common. This way it we pave the terrain for extending the current ISO 19115-1:2014 metadata editors and catalogues to support this model. It also aims for an easy integration of the producer metadata and the user feedback in client applications.
