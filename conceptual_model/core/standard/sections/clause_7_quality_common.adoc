== Requirements Class "Quality-Common"

=== Overview

include::../requirements/requirements_class_quality_common.adoc[]

The Quality-Common requirements class defines the data model classes that are common to, and useful for, both quality metadata generated by producers as well as user feedback metadata. For this reason, the common data model classes are kept in a separate requirements class and related conformance class. In essence, this conformance class represents the foundations for building a user feedback model. This requirements class inherits the ISO 19115-1:2014 and the ISO 19157:2013 metadata models (such as CI_Citation, CI_Date, etc) and adds three extra classes for citing publications (QCM_Publications), for reporting discovered issues (QCM_DiscoveredIssues) and for reporting reproducible usage (QCM_ReproducibleUsage).

=== Citation of publications

CI_Citation was initially designed to cite geospatial datasets. In the following requirement, the Quality Common requirements class is extended to make it more suitable for citing publications.

=== Discovered issue

ISO 19115 proposes the definition of a MD_Usage to document usages of the geospatial resource. This element has been extended in ISO 19115-1:2014 by adding a new property identifiedIssues which allows reporting of known issues associated with the resource, as well as proposed solutions if available. As a more comprehensive alternative, the GUF Standard proposes the following specific class to describe discovered issues of the resource, workarounds and proposed alternatives and solutions.

=== Reproducible usage

MD_Usage was initially designed to document usages of a geospatial resource. In MD_Usage, the specificUsage is a string. Version 2.0 of the GUF conceptual model proposes the following specific class to describe reproducible usage by defining elements to allow reproducibility, for example by describing a codeSnippet (as an string or a linkage) as well as in which application the snippet should be executed.
