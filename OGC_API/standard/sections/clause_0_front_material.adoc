The OGC API standards family includes a set of resources that enable anyone to provide or use geospatial information. These APIs primarily describe the publication and access to data (features), although they may also reference metadata (records).

This document takes a step further by defining the OGC API - Feedback, which builds upon the concept of OGC API - Records. While OGC API - Records is designed to describe metadata associated with resources from the producer's perspective, OGC API - Feedback establishes a standardized way to provide feedback on any catalog element, whether it be data or metadata. This mechanism focuses on users, allowing them to comment, rate, describe usage, report errors or deficiencies, link related documentation, etc. Moreover, it enables the generation of statistics on these evaluations, which can inform user interactions.

Thus, in OGC API - Feedback, the feedback element is the atomic unit of information within a catalog, just as a record is in OGC API - Records. This feedback element must be described conforming to the specifications of this document.

Accordingly, we define the following set of components for OGC API - Feedback:

* a feedback item
* a feedback catalog (a collection of feedback items)
* a common set of query parameters
* the requirements and characteristics for implementing a Feedback API

Since the very nature of feedback is based on user contributions, OGC API - Feedback allows not only the GET method for queries but also adopts from OGC API - Features the capabilities for creating and modifying resources using the POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods.

The following tables lists the endpoints of the OGC API - Feedback that allow a collection of feedback to be searched or to interact with:
