== *Geospatial User Feedback XML encoding*

The XML schemas described here were developed using the encoding rules for creating an XML encoding from a UML model, as documented in ISO 19139 [4]. These encoding rules are coded in the ShapeChange [6] application. ShapeChange is a Java tool that takes application schemas constructed according to ISO 19109 from a UML model and derives implementation representations. ShapeChange was used to automatically transform the OGC 23-017 Geospatial User Feedback Conceptual Model [2] UML model into the XML schemas that are conformant with the encoding rules defined in this Standard. Since the conversion is automatic, this document does not provide tables describing the semantics of each element and the reader should refer to the conceptual model for details.

This encoding is intended for applications where the use of producerâ€™s metadata encoded according to ISO 19115-1:2014 [3] is common. In this way, there is a path for extending the current ISO 19115-1:2014 metadata editors and catalogues to support this model. This encoding also aims for an easy integration of the producer metadata and the user feedback in client applications.
