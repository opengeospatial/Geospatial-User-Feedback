== Conformance
This Standard defines four requirements classes and four related conformance classes.

Requirements for standardization targets are considered: 


*   Requirements Class Quality Common   [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/req/quality-common] has a single conformance class, Quality Common: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/conf/quality-common]. This class targets clients and services implementing quality or user feedback models.

*	Requirements Class Feedback-item [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/req/feedback-item] has a single conformance class, Feedback-item: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/conf/feedback-item]. This class targets clients and services implementing user feedback models.

*	Requirements Class Feedback-summary [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/req/feedback-summary] has a single conformance class, Feedback-summary: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/conf/feedback-summary]. This class targets clients and services implementing user feedback models.

*	Requirements Class Feedback-collection  [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/req/feedback-collection] has a single conformance class, Feedback-collection: [http://www.opengis.net/spec/geospatial-user-feedback/2.0/conf/feedback-collection]. This class targets clients and services implementing user feedback models.

Conformance with this Standard shall be checked using all the relevant tests specified in Annex A (normative) of this document. The framework, concepts, and methodology for testing, and the criteria to be achieved to claim conformance are specified in the OGC Compliance Testing Policies and Procedures and the OGC Compliance Testing web site  footnote:[www.opengeospatial.org/cite].

To conform to this OGC Model, a software implementation may choose to implement:

//* Any one of the conformance levels specified in Annex A (normative).
//* Any one of the Distributed Computing Platform profiles specified in Annexes TBD through TBD (normative).

a)	Any encoding extension associated with this Standard. Initially an XML encoding following the ISO19139 encoding rules is provided in a separate part (OGC 23-061, , OGC Geospatial User Feedback Standard: XML Implementation v.2.0).

b) A JSON encoding will be also provided as a separate part.

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this Standard are owned by the standard(s) identified.
