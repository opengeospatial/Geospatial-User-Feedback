== Requirements Class "User Feedback Item"

=== Overview

This requirements class defines the data model classes that are involved in the definition of an individual user feedback item. A feedback item is the container of the actual feedback. Every item is set into a context by a combination of target, citations and scope.

|abstract | Brief narrative description of this item, normally for display to a human. | Character String type, not empty |  One (mandatory)
|purpose | Summary of the intentions with which the feedback was provided | Character String type, not empty |  Zero or one (optional)
|contact | Information about the user providing feedback | GUF_UserInformation data type (see Table 8) |  One (mandatory)
|contactRole | User's role in the context of this feedback item. A user may have several roles recorded in the GUF_UserInformation, but this is the one that applies for this feedback ^a^. | GUF_UserRoleCode (see Table 10) |  One (mandatory)
|dateInfo | Date when the feedback item was created, updated etc. | CI_Date (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.3.2.6) |  One or more (mandatory)
|itemIsReplyTo | Identifiers of one or more items of feedback to which this item is a response.  | MD_Identifier data type (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.3.3.3) |  Zero or more (optional). Populate only if the feedback item is responding to another feedback item (e.g. an answer to a previous comment). 
|descriptiveKeywords | Keywords that can be useful to search for this item. They are selected from controlled vocabularies | MD_Keywords data type (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.2.3.2) |  Zero or more (optional)
|tag | Free text word that can be useful to search for this item. | Character String type, not empty |  Zero or more (optional))
|locale | Language and character set used within the feedback item | PT_Locale data type (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.3.4.3) |  Zero or more (optional)
|externalFeedback | Link to an item in an external repository that contains the feedback (not described inline). | CI_Citation data type (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.3.2.1) |  Zero or one (optional) ^b^
|additionalQuality | Structured quality assessment result | DQ_DataQuality data type (ISO 19157:2013 C.2.1.1) |  Zero or more (optional) ^b^
|userComment | Text free user comment | GUF_UserComment data type (see Table 13) | Zero or one (optional) ^b^
|usage | Structured usage report | GUF_UsageReport (see Table 15) |  Zero or more (optional) ^b^
|rating | Rating code reflecting the satisfaction of the user with the resource used | GUF_Rating (see Table 17) |  Zero or one (optional) ^b^
|citation | Citation of a published resource (e.g.: a report, a peer reviewed paper) that provides an evaluation of the usage of the resource | CI_Citation data type (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.3.2.1) or, preferably, QCM_Publication data type (see Table 2)|  Zero or more (optional) ^b^
|{set:cellbgcolor:#D6EAF8}additionalLineageSteps | Additional lineage steps not included in the producer metadata | LI_Lineage data type (ISO 19115-1:2014 B.2.5) |  Zero or one (optional) ^b^
|{set:cellbgcolor:#D6EAF8/}significantEvent | Significant natural events or sensor or platform anomalies that can affect the interpretation of the data. | GUF_SignificantEvent (see Table 18) |  Zero or more (optional) ^b^
|target | Identifies a pre-existing resource (e.g., a dataset or a metadata record) from a catalogue. | GUF_FeedbackTarget (see Table 11)|  One or more (mandatory)
4+| ^a^ The idea is for a single user to be able to embody more than one role, but only one in each item. Thus, a data producer employee may comment and normally speak freely as an end user, but may, for example, issue a metadata override on behalf of the data provider if s/he explicitly chooses that role. S/he would only be allowed to choose roles from his/her user information, and maybe there could be additional restrictions. So users seeking reliable but "semi-official" metadata could look for overrides issued by the provider in that role. +
^b^ 	If none of these elements are populated, the item does not provide feedback and should be considered empty.

4+| ^a^	Do not confuse this data type with itemIsReplyTo in GUF_FeedbackItem. In the case where a feedback item replies to another feedback item, this is indicated in itemIsReplyTo. It is expected that the targets of both items are identical including the same resourceRef. +
^b^	If the reference cites a superset of the feedback target, use ‘scope’ to define the right subset of the resource referenced. +
^c^	If more than one is provided they shall point to the same resource. If you have more than one resource, use more than one GUF_FeedbackTarget elements. +
^d^	This may be used to present feedback to users grouped by the parent resources: for example, a user evaluating the quality of a single remotely-sensed image tile may also wish to see feedback on the global set of tiles, or all feedback relating to the entire data collection campaign. +
^e^	If the target is a collection, this can be used to mention its members. +
^f^ If the resource is a metadata record, this element should not be populated; use resourceRef/citation/identifier instead. +
^g^ Corrigenda: in GUF v.1 Conceptual model documentation the role attribute appeared as "targetType". Not in the UML models and XSD schemas, where "role" attribute was correctly documented.

NOTE: This codelist is based on the CHARMe project, which focused primarily on hazards and climatic analysis. (https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/CHAR/Significant+Events). Here, as in other parts of the data model, the codelist approach allows further domain-specific entities to be described and modeled.

=== *Numeric Codelist for rating*

A numeric is a codelist that has a correspondence to a numeric code. This allows for item sorting and numerical calculations such as totals and averages based on the numeric code. Table 20, Table 21 and Table 22 are examples of numeric codelists that can be used for rating.

GUF_RatingCode is intended for implementing a 5 star rating system. This can be used for target resources or for user expertiseLevel. E.g. this is currently used in amazon.com and many other websites.

GUF_ThumbsCode is intended for implementing an “I like” system. GUF_ThumbsCode is expected to be used to give feedback on another feedback item, e.g. to rate the comment of another user about a target resource. E.g. this is currently used in facebook.com “I like” and many other websites.

GUF_SignCode could be used to accompany textual GUF_UserComment to give an indication if the comment is emphasizing a positive aspect, a neutral or a negative aspect (e.g. a complaint). E.g. this is currently used to rate user reputation in ebay.com.
